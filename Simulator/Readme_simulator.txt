This is a simple tutorial for using our simulator. This simulator is only available for use by the member of Yufeng Wu laboratory, and we are not responsible for any possible bugs.

1. Prerequiste.
	pip install numpy
2. File preparation. 
	sim_Recomrdc_reshape.dat: This file is the position file extracted from the macs result file. (Scaled from 0 to 1)
	sim_indv1_gen0_Seq.dat: The genotypes file for each individual in the first generation. (Founders)
	sim_Parent.dat: This file is generated by this simulator, and it is needed after the first chromosome simulation.
3. Usage.
	python main_multi2.py
4. Parameters.
	prefix: The prefix of all the files.
	nindv: Number of individuals per generaiton
	ll: The length of the chromosome. (Extracted from the macs result file)
	No: The total population size in begining.
	Ne: Population size
	Ng: number of generations since admixture
	r: Recombination rate using in macs
	chrs: set as 0 for the first chromsome, and 1 for the rest chromsomes.
5. Outputs.
	sim_Parent.dat: The file stores the parents index during random mating progress.
	sim_indv1_gen5_Seq.dat: The genotypes file for the individual 1 at the fifth generation.
	sim_indv1_gen5_AP.dat: The acestry file stores the ancesties of SNPs.
	sim_indv1_gen5_Rec.dat: This file stores the recombination arrow direction of each SNP.
6. Attachment.
	I also provided a script for finding the ground truth of founders configuration and ratio from simulation.
	python find_list.py (invidual_index) (population size)
	for example, if we want to find the founders configuration of the 175th individual, and the sizes of population A and B are both 100, we can use:
	python find_list.py 175 100
	to find the ground truth.
